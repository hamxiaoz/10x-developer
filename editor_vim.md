## Cheatsheet

To improve, try the following:
- `H/M/L` Move to first/middle/last line of screen
- Edit at the first of the line: `0i` -> `I`
- Go to line number 12: `12G`
- `t` and `f` is different: `t` is to **before the character** where `f` **includes the character**. That's why when you copy to quote you should use `vf'` instead of `vt'` (this will miss the last character before ')

Good to know:
- move screen: `CTRL+e` or `CTRL+y`
- `:x` is same as `:wq`
