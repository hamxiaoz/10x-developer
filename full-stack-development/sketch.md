Move/Sizing/Gap \(when object selected\):

* `ARROW` to move. `SHIFT+ARROW` to move 10px

* Hold `ALT/OPTION` key to show distance to others. If mouse over another object you can see the gap to that mouse over object.

Misc:

#### How to create your own hotkey in Sketch?

* Go to "keyboard" in system preference
* Choose "App Shortcuts" in sidebar
* Click "+"
* Select Sketch in "application"
* Type the exact text as appeared in Sketch in "menu title"
  * Don't forget root menu
  * Use "-&gt;"
  * Don't use any space
* Assign hotkey

For example, I create a hotkey `^i (Ctrl+i) for inserting images, and here is the "menu title":`

`Insert->Image...`
