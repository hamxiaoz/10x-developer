#### How to convert a details array to a map?
Collection reduces to a single object. Borrowed from: https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/examples/sidebar/data.js

```js
const data = [
  {
    name: 'Tacos',

]

const dataMap = data.reduce(function (map, category) {
  category.itemsMap = category.items.reduce(function (itemsMap, item) {
    itemsMap[item.name] = item
    return itemsMap
  }, {})
  map[category.name] = category
  return map
