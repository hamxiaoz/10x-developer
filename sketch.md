# Sketch App

## Tips/Hotkeys

* `R: (rectangle) to create <hr>`
* `S: (slice) to create slice for export`
* `CTRL+C: pick color`
* `CMD+1: for artboard overview`
* `CMD+2: zoom to selected artboard`
* Hold `ALT and use mouse to see space between elements`

### How to create your own hotkey in Sketch?

* Go to "keyboard" in system preference
* Choose "App Shortcuts" in sidebar
* Click "+"
* Select Sketch in "application"
* Type the exact text as appeared in Sketch in "menu title"
  * Don't forget root menu
  * Use "-&gt;"
  * Don't use any space

* Assign hotkey

For example, I create a hotkey `^i (Ctrl+i) for inserting images, and here is the "menu title":`

`Insert->Image...`
