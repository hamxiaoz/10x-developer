## Hotkeys
- `CTRL+C`: pick color

### How to create your own hotkey in Sketch?
- Go to "keyboard" in system preference
- Choose "App Shortcuts" in sidebar
- Click "+"
- Select Sketch in "application"
- Type the exact text as appeared in Sketch in "menu title"
  - Don't forget root menu
  - Use "->"
  - Don't use any space
- Assign hotkey

For example, I create a hotkey `^i` (Ctrl+i) for inserting images, and here is the "menu title": 

`Insert->Image...`
