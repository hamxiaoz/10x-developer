### Notes

* Class: by default members in a class are **public**
* **Enum**: an enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of **numeric** values
* Do we put return type when defining function? Yes
* Type assertion: `(<string>someValue).length;`
* Yes, we have `static`, `readonly`
  * If you want to express **constant**, use `readonly` or `static readonly`.
* Function overload, this is possible in TypeScript but it's not supported by JavaScript.
* Do we have default parameters? Yes
