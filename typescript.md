# TypeScript

- Is this similar to Swift??

#### Notes
- [Learn TypeScript in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/typescript/)
- Class: by default members in a class are public
- Do we put return type when defining function?
- Do we have `constant` `readonly` concepts? Given we have `static`
- Function overloading, it's not supported by JavaScript, is it dangerous to use extensively?
- Do we have default parameters?



```typesript
var a: number;
var message: string;

// you can specify types for params and return type
myFunc(count:number, message:string): number {
}

cla
```
